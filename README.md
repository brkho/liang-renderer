# Liang Renderer
## Overview
Liang Renderer is a physically based renderer based off `pbrt`. Since Liang is intended for educational purposes, there will be less of an emphasis on optimization. However, at the expense of render time, Liang aims to generate production-quality output.

## Todo
Liang is still in its early stages of development. The first goal is to get all of the boilerplate and classes in place to output an image through traditional Whitted-style ray tracing. After I have this baseline integrator, I hope to expand (and speed up) Liang to incorporate Monte Carlo methods to better compete with production-ready renderers like prman and Arnold.
